## Abstract

We present a fully closed-form expression for the SU(2) 3nj recoupling coefficients associated to any trivalent graph. By cutting each edge of the coupling graph and computing matching numbers on the resulting components, one obtains for each edge a ratio. The general 3nj symbol is then given as a product of hypergeometric factors (see the paper for the complete mathematical expression).
