# A Closed-Form Hypergeometric Product Formula for General SU(2) 3nj Recoupling Coefficients

This repository contains a mathematical physics paper on a new closed-form expression for SU(2) 3nj recoupling coefficients.

## Abstract

We present a fully closed-form expression for the SU(2) 3nj recoupling coefficients associated to any trivalent graph. By cutting each edge of the coupling graph and computing matching numbers on the resulting components, one obtains for each edge a ratio ρ_e. The general 3nj symbol is then given as a product of hypergeometric factors:

{3nj}({j_e}) = ∏_{e∈E} 1/(2j_e)! · ₂F₁(-2j_e,½;1;-ρ_e)
